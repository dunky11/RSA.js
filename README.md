## How to do this:
### Generate keypair:
1. Get two random prime numbers -> p and q.
2. Multiply them -> n = p * q. The product of two prime numbers is always a prime number too.
3. Look at all integers 1 ... n. Find out the amount of integers which are not common factors of n(also called coprimes of n).
4. Step 3 can be shortenend with the formula: Ï•(n) = (p-1)(q-1)
